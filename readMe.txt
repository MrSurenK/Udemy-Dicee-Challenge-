Udemy Web Development Bootcamp 2023 - Dicee Challenge 

Objective : Modify the HTML DOM using javascript to display randomised dice images upon each refresh. Keep score and display the winner/draw. 


Notes: 
1.  Basic CSS, HTML and Dice images were provided
2.  Code on dicee.js was created and made by me. My sokution is different from the model answer provided by course. 

Differnces between model answer and mine:
1.  Instead of using .setAttribute("src",randomImageSource) as in the model answer; I used document.querySelector(".img1").src = img url
2.  Used a list to store all the image directories instead of dynamically assigning them to variables using string concatenation.
3.  &#128681 UTF8 code for red flag instead of inserting the emoji into the HTML.

**All files except for dicee.js and readMe does not belong to me**
